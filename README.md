# Dynamic-Dashboard-
A Dynamic Dashboard implemented during an internship in Garment IO

This code contains a simple structure of a dynamic dashboard, with no actions or visual charts, but with dummy values that represent the data transfer and a button,
that when pressed opens a modal requesting some information. Afterwards, the modal closes and the information provided is displayed inside the box that had the pressed
button.
